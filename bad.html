	<h1> How to improve my breakout game to make it more like Arkanoid</h1>
	  <ol>Add power-ups: You can add power-ups that drop when certain bricks are hit. These power-ups can give the player different abilities such as an enlarged paddle, extra balls, or even a laser that can destroy multiple bricks.</ol>
	  <ol>Add different types of bricks: In Arkanoid, there are different types of bricks that require multiple hits to destroy. You can add similar bricks to your game, which can increase the game's difficulty.</ol>
	  <ol>Add levels: In Arkanoid, each level is more difficult than the last. You can add multiple levels to your game, each with a different layout of bricks and a higher difficulty.</ol>
	  <ol>Add sound effects: Sound effects can make the game more engaging and exciting. You can add sound effects when the ball bounces off a brick, when a power-up is collected, or when the player loses a life.</ol>
	  <ol>Add a high score board: A high score board can motivate players to continue playing the game and improve their scores. You can add a high score board that displays the top scores of all players who have played the game.</ol>
